# 🌙 Flymoon: Capture the Impossible

## Where Aviation Meets Astronomy

Imagine capturing the exact moment a commercial airliner crosses the face of the Sun or Moon. A split-second event requiring perfect timing, precise positioning, and a bit of luck. **Flymoon makes the impossible routine.**

## The Vision

> *"What if we could predict when aircraft would transit across celestial bodies from any location on Earth?"*

This question sparked the imagination of **David Betancourt Montellano**, whose innovative vision brought together two worlds that rarely intersect: aviation tracking and astrophotography. The result is Flymoon—a sophisticated tool that turns fleeting cosmic coincidences into predictable, capturable moments.

## What Makes Flymoon Special

### 🎯 Precision You Can Trust

Flymoon doesn't guess—it calculates. Using real-time flight data and precise astronomical calculations, it predicts transits up to 15 minutes in advance with accuracy measured in degrees and seconds.

**The difference between missing a shot and capturing perfection.**

### 🗺️ See the Whole Picture

A beautiful interactive map shows you everything at once:
- Aircraft positions updating in real-time
- Color-coded probability markers (🟢 High, 🟠 Medium, 🟡 Low)
- Sun and Moon positions with azimuth indicators
- Flight paths showing where aircraft have been and where they're going
- Your observer position as the center of it all

**No more guessing. No more missed opportunities.**

### 📊 Data That Makes Sense

The flight table isn't just numbers—it's intelligence. See at a glance:
- Which flights are most likely to transit
- Exact timing down to the second
- Angular differences that matter
- Aircraft type, altitude, heading, and speed

Click any row or aircraft to track it. Click again to release. **Simple, intuitive, powerful.**

### 🔭 Automatic Capture

Connected to a Seestar S50 telescope? Flymoon can control it automatically:
- Detects high-probability transits
- Starts recording at the perfect moment
- Includes buffer time before and after
- Falls back to manual notifications if needed

**Set it and forget it. Flymoon handles the timing.**

### 📱 Never Miss a Moment

Telegram notifications keep you informed:
- "High probability transit detected" - plenty of time to prepare
- "Transit imminent in 3 minutes" - get ready
- Detailed flight information and exact timing
- Rich formatted messages you can read at a glance

**Your phone becomes your co-pilot.**

## Real-World Use Cases

### 🎨 The Astrophotographer

*"I spent months trying to catch one solar transit. With Flymoon, I captured three in a single week."*

Set up your camera, monitor Flymoon's predictions, and capture images that would have been nearly impossible to plan just a few years ago. The kind of shots that make people ask "how did you do that?"

### ✈️ The Aviation Enthusiast

Track aircraft with unprecedented detail. Know not just what's flying overhead, but exactly when it will cross your target. Perfect for identifying interesting aircraft or capturing unique perspectives.

### 🏫 The Educator

Demonstrate real-time orbital mechanics, coordinate systems, and data visualization. Students see abstract concepts come to life as aircraft and celestial bodies dance across their screens in perfect mathematical harmony.

### 🔬 The Researcher

Study transit frequencies, flight patterns, and celestial alignments. The data Flymoon provides opens doors to questions we haven't even thought to ask yet.

## The Technology Behind the Magic

Flymoon combines:
- **FlightAware's AeroAPI** for real-time aircraft data
- **Skyfield astronomical library** for sub-arc-second celestial calculations  
- **JPL ephemeris data** for precise Sun and Moon positions
- **Angular separation algorithms** to predict alignments
- **Leaflet mapping** for intuitive visualization
- **Telegram Bot API** for instant notifications

All wrapped in a clean, modern interface that just works.

## Getting Started is Easy

```bash
# Three commands to magic:
git clone https://github.com/Tailspin45/flymoon.git
cd flymoon
make setup

# Add your coordinates to .env
# python3 app.py

## The Credit Where It's Due

This project exists because **David Betancourt Montellano** asked "what if?" and then had the vision to make it real.

*Creado con profundo agradecimiento por la idea y el diseño inicial de David Betancourt Montellano*

The original concept, the initial design, the spark that started it all—that's David's legacy. Flymoon continues to build on that foundation.

## What Users Say

*"I thought catching a lunar transit was pure luck. Flymoon proved me wrong. It's like having a crystal ball for astrophotography."*

*"The map visualization is brilliant. I finally understand what 'angular separation' actually means."*

*"Three clicks and I'm tracking a 737 crossing the Moon. This is the future."*

*"The Telegram notifications mean I never miss an opportunity, even when I'm not at my computer."*

## Your Next Transit is Waiting

Every day, thousands of aircraft cross the face of the Sun and Moon. Most go unnoticed. Uncaptured. Lost to time.

**Flymoon changes that.**
